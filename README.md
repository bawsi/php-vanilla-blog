**This is a simple blog, made purely in PHP. It is my first "major" project. **
*
Once I am finished with it, I will be making a similar blog, only that it will use a single index.php file in public directory, which will act as a router. All requests will be routed to that index.php using mod_rewrite, and that index file then pulls in the correct views.*
